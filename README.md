Explanation to task "Replicate code from slide 8, create instances of car and truck. Try to call different 
methods for both, investigate output and explain why":

Method displayInfo() can be called on instances of Car and Truck classes, for it's a method of parent class. 
Method transportPeople() can be called only on instances of Car class, for it's a subclass,
just like transportContainer() can be called only on instances of Truck class, which is a subclass as well.
